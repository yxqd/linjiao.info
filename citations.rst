* J Phys.:Condensed Matter 15 (2003) 3805-3811: In this work, we adopt the formalism of Hughes and Sipe [18] to calculate the optical susceptibilities. Their formula used in the calculation of SHG coefficients was rearranged by Rashkeev et al [19] to show Kleinman symmetry explicitly. Lin et al [20] improved the formula in the static limit by avoiding possible divergent terms; thus they were able to achieve good convergence on the k-point sampling, as we did before by using a different formula that does not present Kleinman symmetry explicitly [21]. Here we point out that the formula of Lin et al can be further simplified by abandoning the so-called two-bands term, which can be proved to be zero after some straightforward algebra.

* J Appl. Phys. 106, 103107 (2009): The SHG coefficients are calculated by our improved calculation formula,11 which has been successfully applied on a lot of NLO crystals such as BABO, KABO,12 and KBBF.13   (reference 11 is the paper)


* Phys Rev B 78, 235110 (2004): To evaluate the SHG coefficients, we have adapted the formalism proposed by Rashkeev and later improved by Lin.
